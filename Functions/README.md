# Simple Contract Interaction

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Ethereum smart contract and a frontend application to interact with it.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract has two functions:
- `updateMessage`: Updates the stored message.
- `incrementCounter`: Increments a counter.

## Frontend Application

The frontend application connects to the smart contract using Web3.js and allows users to interact with it.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Deploy the smart contract using a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache).
3. Update the contract address and ABI in the frontend application.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
